Hello Graders !


i was downgraded in mp-1 for these reasons:

1. (-1 point) Nav bar buttons unresponsive to screen size changes. 

2. (-1 point) Calculator buttons unstyled and very small. Images not displayed on Projects page.

3. (-1 point) Credit link in footer does not navigate to the intended page.


i know you wanted in mp-3 for it to be the exact same code, however i wanted to fix the errors you have noticed in mp-1.
so:
 1. i have fixed the unresponsive nav bar to screen size change, however. when you said unresponsive the links still work and in mp-1 i protrayed it to be next to one another.
 but It makes sense that it doesnt look the pretiest so i made it a column with margins in between each navigations in mp-3 for you.

 2. i have styled the Calculator button in mp-3 which was downgraded in mp-1.

 3. I have added a navigation link for credit link in mp-3 which wasnt there in mp-1.
